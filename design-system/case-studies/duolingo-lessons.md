# Case Study Lessons — Duolingo Design

## Coverage status (2026-07-13)

**Playwright full-text scrape: 17/17 pages OK** (hub + 16 content routes). Raw extracts live in `research/case-studies/raw/duolingo-*.md` + `inventory.json`.

Public site is a **brand bible SPA** (not a product component system). Canonical content inventory:

### Identity
- `/identity/logos` — clear space, min size, lockups, misuse
- `/identity/color` — named digital/print values
- `/identity/typography` — custom + fallback stacks
- `/identity/imagery` — photo/image direction
- `/identity/brand-family` — sub-brand construction

### Writing
- `/writing/brand-narrative`
- `/writing/voice`
- `/writing/tone`
- `/writing/duo` — character verbal contract
- `/writing/style`
- `/writing/glossary` — canonical/prohibited terms

### Illustration
- `/illustration/shape-language`
- `/illustration/duo` — construction
- `/illustration/characters`

### Other
- `/marketing/assets`
- `/resources`

## What was already known vs fully operationalized in AwesomeDS

| Lesson | Prior ADS | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Brand personality as system | thin brand modules | cross-medium contract |
| Voice/tone matrices | partial content-design | full matrix template |
| Character production grammar | illustration stub | character-system module |
| Page pattern principle→example→misuse | uneven | documented sequence |
| Product UI / a11y / motion on Duolingo site | N/A (not published there) | covered by other sources |

## Transferable principles (anti-imitation)

1. Personality is a **production system**, not adjectives.
2. Writing systems need **glossary + forbidden terms**.
3. Illustration needs **geometry + complexity budget + misuse gallery**.
4. Characters need **anatomy + emotion limits + who may speak**.
5. Sub-brands inherit with **explicit family rules**.
6. Public brand sites can still be **product-stale** — revalidate facts.

## Historical fossils warning

Treat product stats, plan names (e.g. legacy Plus), OS version examples, and learner counts as **historical**, not current product truth.

## Linked rules
- `rule.brand.cross-medium-coherence`
- `rule.brand.content-design`
- `rule.brand.illustration-grammar`

## Operational depth

Registration is not absorption. The route-by-route completion audit is
`research/duolingo-complete-audit-2026-07.md`; the resulting executable,
brand-neutral production doctrine lives in `brand/duolingo-derived/`.
